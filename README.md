Given an arithmetic expression in infix or postfix notation, the goal of this assignment is to :</br>
</br>1. Write a program that converts the expression to another notation using expression trees.
</br>2. Evaluate the expression.
</br>The main idea consists of the following steps :
</br>1. Convert the given (input) expression into a postfix notation (if it is not the case).
</br>2. Construct the expression tree from the postfix representation.
</br>3. Evaluate the expression tree or print it into another notation
