1. Input to the program is a string with expression. 
2. It can handle with/without space in between number and the operator. 
3. characters are programmed to be an invadlid expression. 
4. It can also handle numbers with more than 1 digit. 
5. For Example: 
   #valid Input Expression:: 1.(12 + 14 * 34) 
                            2. 12 13 +
